A/C#    F#m                    E
  Oh   thinking about our younger years
          Bm           F#m
There was only you and me 
         G                 E            A  
We were young and wild and free
     F#m                   E
Now nothing can take you away from me
           Bm               F#m
We've been down that road before
            G      
But that's over now
            E
You keep me coming back for more


[Chorus]

D           E          F#m   
Baby you're all that I want 
            A                D
When you're lying here in my arms
D                E          F#m            E
I'm finding it's hard believe we're in heaven
    D       E          F#m       
‘Cos love is all that I need 
      A                      D
And I found it there in your heart
    D         E      F#m              E
It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven


[Verse]

A/C#   F#m                       E
   Oh, once in your life, you find someone
         Bm                F#m
Who will turn your world around
          G                      E    A
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
     F#m                          E
Yeah, nothing can change what you mean to me
             Bm                F#m 
OOh, There's lots that I could say
          G             
But just hold me now
          E
‘Cos our love will light the way


[Middle 8]

Bm                  A/C#    D
  I've been waiting for so long
     D        E   F#m
For something to arrive
                  E/G# 
For love to come along
A Bm                   A/C#      D  
    Now our dreams are coming true
                              A
Throw the good times and the bad
              Esus4             E
Yeah, I'll be standing there by you

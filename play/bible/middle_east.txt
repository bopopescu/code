1. Israel wants to live in peace as Jewish state
2. Israel recognizes the right of Palestine to have their own state

Most Palestinians don't recognize the rights of the Jewish state of Israel to exist
In 1947 the UN voted to divide the land called Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state
The Jews accepted the UN partition but no Arab accepted it.

On May 15, 1948, British rule ended, armies of all neighboring Arab states: Lebabnon,
Syria, Iraq, Transjordan, and Egypt attacked the 1 day old state of Israel.  The Jews survived.

In 1967, under Egypt's dictator Gamal Abdel Nasser, they were attacked again, the plan: "destroy Israel"
Egyption troops on Israel's border & surrounding Arab countries were mobilized and attacked, but
Israel preemptively attacked Egypt & Syria (not Jordan), they begged Jordan's king not to join the
war, but they did, so Israel took control of Jordanian land, the West Bank of the Jordan River.

After the war in 1967, the Arab states went to Khartoum, Sudan and announced their famous
    "Three Nos"
    1. no recognition
    2. no peace
    3. no negotiation

In 1978 Israel gave the entire Sinai Peninsula, an area bigger than Israel itself (and w/oil) back to
Egypt because Egypt was under new leadership and signed a peace agreement w/Israel.

In 2000, Israel proposed trading land for peace, and agreed to give the Palestinians a sovereign state
of greater than 95% of the West Bank and all of Gaza.  The Palestinians rejected the offer
and in response sent suicide bombers into Israel.

The Pals engaged in propoganda via radio, TV and school curricula

Hamas, led by Palestinian rulers.

There are 22 Arab states in the world, and only 1 tiny Jewish state.

The Palestinian areas have always been occupied by Jews:
    1st Kingdom: 1000 - 586 BC
    2nd Kingdom:  538 -  63 BC
    3rd Kingdom: Israel

Never a non-Jewish state occupied it
Never an Arab state
Never a Palestinian state
Never a Muslim state

I am listing down areas where Programs are Coded in C, Other Language are not being used there
1) OS Kernel
2) Device-Drivers 
3) Core Networking(DataPath, TCP/IP Stack) 
4) Embedded Systems
 
So These are the field where C Programmers will always have a scope.There are two aspect 
1) C at Application Level 
2) C at System Level.
C at application Level work is being replaced by Modern Languages 

but C at System Level is Still used  very  heavily. 

Future C Programmer Should Contains The Following Skills 

Platform/Processor Understanding/Knowledge, 
Assembly,  
Strong Data Structures /Algo, 
Hardware Understanding, 
In-Depth OS Knowledge
Computer Architecture.Kernel Knowledge. Debugging Skills.
All in One!!!!!, Whereas Application Level C Programmer need not to know all these.

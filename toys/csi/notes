Heaps: 
    Order statistics: K/Kth largest elements
    Heap sort - in place, no quadratic scenarios
    Dijkstra's algorithm (shortest path), 
    Prim's algorithm (minimum spanning tree) 
    Huffman encoding (data compression).    
    Selection - min, max, median, kth in sublinear time
    Priority Queue

Hash:
    recall previous values - anagrams

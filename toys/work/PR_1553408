Using weevil tool

Repro steps:
1.  collectsamlogs and collectskiplogs script found here 
    \\desmo\wds\PLE\Users\dah\Tools\Scripts
2.  Use weevil command >logflush
3.  Run step 1 again to have a copy of the current logs
4.  Use weevil command >logclr to "clear Flash logs"
5.  Restart Windows
6.  run step 1 again.  This time look at copy of logs 

Expected result:
After logflush, logclr again, the trace logs should be empty

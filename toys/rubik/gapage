Description

As part of a small, passionate, and accomplished advanced development team, you will be the flight software architect of the Blue Moon lunar lander responsible for architecture, development, execution, and management of the Blue Moon flight software. You will also be responsible for standing up a team of embedded software engineers supporting flight software development for various subsystems. The Flight Software Lead understands the broad scope of flight software development for a space system while cognizant of the fine details that make the system robust and reliable. The position requires strong collaboration with other subsystems necessary for command and control of the spacecraft such as guidance, navigation, and control, engines, avionics, and communications. You should be comfortable working in a fast-paced and often uncertain environment, contributing to innovative solutions, while demonstrating personal leadership, technical competence, and attention to detail. This position will directly impact the history of space exploration and will require your dedicated commitment and detailed attention towards safe and reliable spaceflight.

Responsibilities
Collaborate with subsystem leads to define and develop top level software requirements, architecture and designs
Facilitate trade space decisions and bring teams to consensus for flight software architectures, layers, components, and applications
Oversee development of rapid prototypes to prove out architecture/design concepts and quantify technical risks
Oversee development of fault tolerant flight software for the command and data handling subsystem responsible for the overall command and control of the lander as well as software modules for other subsystems
Drive requirements for development and test of board support packages for embedded platforms
Oversee development of simulation of target environment to accelerate development and integration testing
Oversee efforts to integrate software components, create and run unit tests, validate on Hardware-in-the-Loop and release real-time embedded solutions
Coordinate with hardware, control and system engineers to plan, develop, and lead system verification and qualification, to ensure software products that meet system requirements and safety-critical standards
Lead and contribute to production of technical documentation for software architecture, design, verification plans
Leading and mentoring other hardware and software development engineers on the team
Plan and manage schedule, resource, and personnel assignments
Qualifications:

Required
B.S. in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, or related engineering with 10+ years of design experience including 3+ years of experience of flight software project management

About us

Blue Origin is empowered by a vision where millions of people are living and working in space. To achieve our vision, we are developing reusable rocket engines and launch vehicles that will dramatically lower the cost of access to space.

Our record-setting New Shepard was the first fully reusable vertical takeoff, vertical landing space vehicle, flying five times above the Karman line and landing safely back on Earth. Powered by our robust BE-3 engine, New Shepard is preparing to take astronauts to space and back starting in 2018.

We’ve also introduced the New Glenn orbital launch vehicle designed for operational reusability. BE-4, the world’s most powerful liquid oxygen / liquefied natural gas engine, will enable New Glenn to launch payloads over 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit and 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit beginning in 2020.

Driven by our motto, Gradatim Ferociter or “step by step, ferociously,” our incremental approach builds upon each success as we develop ground-breaking spaceflight systems. We don’t just build rockets—we build a culture around methodical innovation and exploration. Are you ready to go to space?

Fresh ideas (understanding):

Goal: understand and code all algorithms in C

Algorithms
==========
Brute force:
    [c] selection sort
    [c] bubble sort
    [c] sequential search
    [c] string match
    [c] anagram
    [c] palindrome
Divide and Conquer: 
    [c] merge sort
    [c] quicksort
Decrease and Conquer
    [c] binary search
    [c] insertion sort
    [c] dfs
    [c] bfs
Transform and Conquer
    [c] heapsort (max)
Dynamic Programming
    [c] warshall
    [c] floyd
Greedy
    [c] prim # broken, not too bad though, got question to udemy
    [*] kruskal

list: reverse, merge, zip, cycle detect
tree: balance, traverse
string: match, join, split, anagram, palindrome

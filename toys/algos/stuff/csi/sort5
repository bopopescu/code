Given 25 integers and a CPU with SORT5 instruction, find
the 1st, 2nd and 3rd largest values using a minimum of calls
to SORT5.

key: eliminate all x in S where there are at least 3 in S > x,
only 5 integers will remain, and only one more call to SORT5
is needed.

[0 -> 4]
1 2 3 12 15 

[5 -> 9]
4 5 16 33 44 

[10 -> 14]
23 45 55 66 67 

[15 -> 19]
11 32 87 90 98 

[20 -> 24]
13 41 42 62 82

* Description:
*
* Note: Use of this source file is explained further in the application
* note #459, titled, "Guidelines for Developing a Nios II HAL Device Driver".
*
* The following is a uart polled mode test program.
* Change the STDIO values for your bsp to uart1 (or the name of your hardware
* design's uart peripheral).
*
* In alt_sys_init.c, comment out the line
* to INIT the Uart.  We will initialize the uart here instead, simulating
* the way you would initialize a new device for which the INIT macro does
* not yet exist.
*
* Requirements:
*   -Supported Example Hardware Platforms
*     Full Featured
*   -Supported Development Boards
*     Nios II Embedded Development Kit
*     (To port this test code to other boards, just replace the uart
*     hard-coded base address value of 0x80 used in main()
*     with the uart register base address of the target board.
*     If the uart has a name other than 'uart1', the UART1_BASE
*     macro usage must be changed to reflect the new device name.
*   -Board Support Package Settings
*     STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR:  uart1
*   -Know Issues
*     None

/* Include alt_log logging facility for debugging. MACROS are used to bypass
 * the driver and access the peripheral directly, so that messages can be
 * printed during boot before devices get initialized.
 *
 * Set hal.log_port to the desired logging device, using the name as specified
 * in SOPC Builder, such as jtag_uart or uart1 for the AN459 example HW design.
 * system.h will be generated to
 * set the following parameters to use alt_log with jtag_uart:
 *
 *          alt_log_port_base = "JTAG_UART_BASE";
 *          alt_log_port_type = "altera_avalon_jtag_uart";
 *
 * The SOF image does not need to be regenerated in SOPC Builder or
 * recompiled in Quartus.  Only the application and board support package
 * need to have their makefiles modified and to be recompiled.  This can
 * be accomplished by using the following
 * switches to the nios2-bsp command in a create-this-bsp script:
 *
 * --set hal.log_flags 3
 * --set hal.log_port jtag_uart
 *
 * The hal.log_port and hal.log_flags settings will cause the following
 * build flags to be specified in the public.mk makefile fragment shared by
 * app and bsp projects:
 *
 *          -DALT_LOG_ENABLE
 *          -DALT_LOG_FLAGS=3
 *
 * ALT_LOG_FLAGS valid value range is -1 to 3.
 *    (3 is the most verbose, 0 is boot messages only, -1 is silent.)
 *
 * The writes are blocking by default, so a terminal (such as the
 * nios2-terminal command) needs to accept the alt_log output in order for
 * the Nios II application to complete boot initialization.
 *
 * You can add alt_log diagnostic messages to your code by invoking
 * ALT_LOG_PRINTF(), a macro that handles most printf options except for
 * floating point (%f or %g).

/* The following definitions from altera_nios2\HAL\inc\io.h for macros IORD()
 * and IOWR() translate into ldwio and stwio Nios II assembler instructions
 * which bypass the cache, reading and writing values directly to peripheral
 * memory mapped registers.
 *
#define __IO_CALC_ADDRESS_NATIVE(BASE, REGNUM) \
  ((void *)(((alt_u8*)BASE) + ((REGNUM) * (SYSTEM_BUS_WIDTH/8))))

#define IORD(BASE, REGNUM) \
  __builtin_ldwio (__IO_CALC_ADDRESS_NATIVE ((BASE), (REGNUM)))
#define IOWR(BASE, REGNUM, DATA) \
  __builtin_stwio (__IO_CALC_ADDRESS_NATIVE ((BASE), (REGNUM)), (DATA))

 * The above macros implement native addressing, an addressing mode that has
 * been deprecated, since Altera is moving to a direct addressing model.
 * New peripherals should be written to use byte enable signals.
 * New device drivers for these new peripherals should use direct
 * addressing macros instead, such as IORD_32DIRECT().  Offsets for direct
 * address macros are always in bytes.
 *
 * The bit_bang_uart example application uses native addressing.
 * The my_uart device driver also uses native addressing, as do all Altera
 * device drivers in version 9.1.
 *
 * For example, use of a native addressing macro:
 *   IOWR(UART1_BASE, 2, 0);
 *
 * translates to the following direct addressing macro:
 *   IOWR_32DIRECT(UART1_BASE, 8, 0);
 *
 * Notice that the offset specified is now 8 bytes, instead of 2 long words.
 *
 * For more details on direct addressing macros, see the "Nios II Software
 * Developer's Handbook", chapter 9 - "Cache and Tightly-Coupled Memory",
 * Table 9-1, "HAL I/O macros to Bypass the Data Cache".

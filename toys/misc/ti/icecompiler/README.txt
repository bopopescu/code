Hey guys!

===== ICE Compiler =====

I'm more than happy to see that you have downloaded my program, ICE Compiler.
This program compiles a TI-BASIC-like language to assembly, the machine code.
In that way, the OS doesn't need to interpret TI-BASIC, compile it to assembly,
and run that assembly code, so this program can be MUCH faster than the original
TI-BASIC. Create awesome games, with an incredible speed, using the awesome
color screen. Of course, there are many limitations, because TI-BASIC itself
is pretty extensive. That is why I included a commands list. I highly 
recommend you to take a look at that list, to see what you can all include 
in your program. Also, although you can assume I've tested it thoroughly, it
can happen that either ICE or you do something wrong, that causes a RAM reset.
That is why you should use CEmu if possible, an emulator for the TI-84+CE.
You can download it here: https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu 
If you are pretty sure you didn't anything wrong, and ICE is the problem, 
please post it in the ICE thread at Cemetech: http://cemete.ch/p247260.

I hope you like my program, and feel free to post any bugs, comments or
whatever you want to :)

===== Usage =====
- Transfer ICE.8xp ICEHOOKS.8xv and ICEDEBUG.8xv to CEmu or a real calc using 
  TI-Connect CE
- Run ICE with Asm(prgmICE); now it will show a list with all the
  ICE source programs. Select one with the [UP] and [DOWN] arrows
  and press [ENTER] to start compiling

- If you want to use the computer version, run

    ice INPUT.8xp

  from the command line, where INPUT.8xp is the name if your input program,
  including the .8xp extension.

[E] Merge: VnV checklist for PinRemap (PR 5680) 
[B] HW: Debug remote NVRAM read
[ ] Merge: PR 5751 migrate sensors from ADP to MCP
[D] Tools: Coefficient Changer - readback/verify/retry
[J] Mag Helmholtz calibration

[*] Merge: PR 5768 UI, H/W Timer, ADC, COEFF_FAULT, remove PWM CBIT, update hdrs
[ ] Merge: Clutches and Actuators

[j] Seg: Mag Helmholtz calibration: 485 > 9600
[*] Seg: MX App RMW 4 segments - separately loadable PF segments (PR 5657)
[*] Seg: New binary segment layout design: CRC/SN mgmt
[ ] Seg: research fault strings to NVRAM new segment

[ ] HW: code ADP ADC and integrate: init/read to Signals -> channel coeffs
[ ] HW: code new new MAG
[*] HW: OAT integration - needs MCP sharing and MEDIAN select in ADP

[*] Cbit: Trim I/L mons (needs PR), keep adp_cmd and act_pos monitors only - FHA trace
[ ] Cbit: Enable Act_Mgmt
[ ] Cbit: Check CRC RAM Data (coefficients ...)

[ ] Robust: add Watchdog and fault if frame catchup fails
[ ] Robust: dead processor & neighbor logs loss-of-comm fault - see Jan 20 flt logs
[ ] Robust: sensors sometimes don't startup

[ ] Tools: GUI requirements writeup
[ ] Tools: MX App add UI for dip angle and field strength to 3-axis cal
[ ] Tools: pipe_plot.py UI: start/stop pitch/roll capture N secs and trigger
[ ] Tools: PF make.bat UI switches

Process:
01. pick a module (if VnV'd diff w/trunk, else diff w/DevBr)
02. create PR
03. make branch and checkout
04. mkdir in PRs dirs: doc/was/is and copy was/is modules
05. update requirements doc w/doors replica in word
06. copy doc/is to PR branch and checkin
07. request peer review
08. fix stuff per peer review
09. add CCB checklist
10. submit to CCB
11. update DOORS - add PRs to RQMTs
12. update tags in code and chk-in
13. update VnV list w/change bars enabled
14. push to DevBr

Notes:
1. Data Dict -> out to SDD
2. Proto out -> list of publics/privates
3. VnV add other related PRs
4. Run doxygen
5. Baseline DOORS multiple PRs

CCQ Questions:

1. Is it Safety Related? 
   Yes.

2. Has it been Tested? By Who? How?  
   Yes, Bart, by Sim test.

3. Does it fix the initial problem?  
   Yes.

4. Is it for a customer? (Robinson)  
   No.

5. Does it affect previous V&V work? [If so, put in the correct Tag] (Has the module/part been released before?)  
   Yes, updated VnV list will be provided.

6. Has it been Reviewed? By Whom?  
   Emily.

7. If SW, have all builds been tested? (Unit TEst, VS Sim, ServerSims, XPLane Plugins, MXAPP, CAN Demux, etc.)  
   N/A

8. If SW, is there a list of all the previously released files affected by this change?  
   N/A

Port the Frame_Mgmt_MCP.c module from the MxRewrite branch to the DevBr.

The purpose of this PR is to port the Frame_Mgmt_MCP.c module from the Mx_Rewrite branch to the DevBr.  Clean up the code and update the requirements as necessary.  Then release the module to VnV with the updated VnV checklist.
   
I have reviewed Emily's proposed requirements and code changes and approve.

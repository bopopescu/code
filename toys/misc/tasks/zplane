[ ] 3-axis cal - parallelize
    1. input mag in counts (currently Gauss)
    2. de-bias in counts (currently in Gauss)
    3. rotate -> Gauss
    4. flip compass LHS-> RHS
    5. LSE
    6. output Gauss HAP and text
    7. write remote NVRAM

    accel
    1. collect sample
    2. correct sample
    3. median select
    4. accumulate
    mag
    1. collect sample or skip if invalid
    2. coreect sample to RHS
    4. accumulate
    

[ ] AH_Tuning => add prev shared and valid 3 slots, also add remote NVRAMs to Sim
    [ ] Remote NVRAM
    [ ] 3 slot mag sharing w/accel & use previous
    [ ] Debug no shared mag output
[ ] Broken MX_Rewrites: Rev=25260=NG, Rev=24897=OK
[ ] coeff changer -> RMW any address (w/LLVM mapping) - drake

[ ] PR: 5886 ADAHRS SSRD level requirements are minimal and do not trace up to ARCH
[ ] PR: 5883 mimic ModelCommon::I2C -> MCP sections and DD

[ ] 485: Write Register Burst overflows SC700
[ ] 485: Write Burst Continue has duplicate code
[ ] 485: See Write Burst Finish as good example

[ ] IPC mag + accel => SYSTEM_IPC_DATA_STRUCT Stage_2
[ ] CBIT: delta xyz mag & frame count => throw fault
[ ] outputs.mag_vector memset only in init, so always a previous value
[ ] Parser: Fix COEFF parser - path reversal & parse Schema for ADAHRS unit test
[ ] Parser: Auto detect which TELEMETRY struct to parse RAW or STD

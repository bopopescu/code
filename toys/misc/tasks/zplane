Find umbrella for Barb
20 x 28 x 3/4" plywood

******** Status Reports due on Monday ********
Short Term Goals:
•	Stop ADP flash if a processor dies on startup only
•	ADP G-limiting control code (0.7 - 1.3) range (Jeff)
•	Add OAT CBIT
Other:
•	Move MX Tests to Mfg only build -> M:\code\tasks\bringup\mx_tests.diff (rev 22961)
•	Would like to implement portable threading in the embedded system

[X] Complete merge into DevBr
[x] Stress test Sim w/OATs
[x] Fix release build DevBr
[x] Dual mag swing in hangar
[ ] Investigate WebASM
[ ] User_Input_HW.c ??? fix
[ ] Timer_HW_CM3
[ ] Target_Hardware_Defs -> #define 3110 to header
[ ] I2C_High_Level -> rename to ADP/MCP specific disambiguate
[ ] CPD_Device delete
[ ] IRQ priorities of motors vs I2C
[ ] Mx_Mode_Common #Debug -> ConvertPortNameToBase
[ ] System_Log -> gut it
[ ] Hall_POST coeffs to MCP
[ ] Software_Defs - delete DISPLAY_ATTITUDE
[ ] ADAHRS - AGPTi, MX, MN to MCP ADAHRS coeffs
[ ] Clutch Control debug wrappers
[ ] One header to control flight vs sim
[ ] Config Mgmt MCP fix nightmare matrices fixups
[ ] MANUFACTURING_TEST ??
[ ] General move of magic #'s to coeffs

Report for Week of 06-03-2019: -> to zdone
=============================
o Create list of remaining software items necessary for CERT
o Drake: Begin porting CANDEMUX to Linux
o Drake: Research using Websockets for MX appliance
o Work with David and Drake to support their tasks
o ADU brinup
o Emily merge mgmt - Do DevBr build and assss
o Drake document i2c & rs485 using swim lanes
o David: develop error recovery for RS485 - use DB9 breakout
o CBIT: delta xyz mag & frame count => throw fault

I2C/RS485 AH_28_V2 Remaining Mods:
=================================
> AH_28_V2: add local & remote NVRAM & System_Logging
                               
Remaining Tasks:
===============
o HAP Segments
o CBIT: Sensor data integrity
o MX enhancements

Tools:
> coeff changer -> RMW any address (w/LLVM mapping) - drake
> Parser: Fix COEFF parser - path reversal & parse Schema for ADAHRS unit test

HAP segments:
> Footer - crc32 (full payload at once)
> inst & mfg segs name strs - 15 bytes
> store crcs in segs and flash in binary seg
> version string of oceff file (seg-name)

> PR: 5886 ADAHRS SSRD level requirements are minimal and do not trace up to ARCH
> PR: 5883 mimic ModelCommon::I2C -> MCP sections and DD

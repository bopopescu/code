[x][] Acuators opposite direction (sign problem)
[x][] In MX mode - disable sensors unless capturing sensors 1 frame
[x][] Loading coefficients - fix mxmode
[x][] Fix HALL test - see pwm voltage = 0 <- wire in POST mode
[x][] Disable motors & PWM on override
[x][] Separate roll/pitch clutch control
[x][] CAUTION light debug
[x][] Debug IBIT - fails w/annunciator lights always on
[x][] 2nd ADC reading for 2nd servo loop per frame
[x][] Split mag i/o
[x][] Write all motor phase pins in one instruction instead of 9.
[x][] Add new hardware timer CCP
[x][] Fix ADAHRs (in ServoLoopCurrentControl & Servo200)
[x][] Collapse common header structs
[x][] Change Robinson to Bart
[x][] Servo loop timing - 1750 clocks - 22 usec
[x][] Fix scheduler ADC0 #2 relative to ADC #1 -> mark/set/go
[x][] Why TRANSACTION_STATE has common & context COMMON (i2c high level.h) trim members
[x][] remove IPC sync chk pts in main loop
[x][] Mag on startup - run same code on all 3 processors whether or not they are successful
[x][] Debug crashes on Attitude Indicator
[x][] Add 2nd servo loop run on 2nd ADC data
[x][352] Pin remap
[x][] Move sensors from ADP to MCP
[x][] Re-define IPC messages for new sensor layout
[x][327] Update override detection
[x][] refactor main MCP loop to work with async I2C
[x][] more refactor of main MCP loop to do 200 Hz servo loop
[x][] Add current control to servo loop
[x][] Update Signals_MCP scheduler
[x][] Refactor scheduler - task array of devices
[x][] New calibration platter in the oven
[x][318] Live strip charts - 20/30 Hz
[x][] Debug RS485_HW_Init (cleanup)
[x][] parser for Telemetry_Log Strip charts
[x][] dev ADP telemetry parser
[x][] Stick switch binary mapping
[x][] Add OAT sensor
[x][] Merge Ray + Dmitry + Bartb branches into Flight branch
[x][] Get RS485 to DB-9 for helmholtz for James
[x][] autogen main.cpp parser, candemux live as well
[x][] added sensor faults annunciation
[x] automated frequency sweep
[x] i2c reset only at startup
[x] use mfg & inst cal segments for mag (ie, remote nvram)
[x] debug remote NVRAM reads at startup -> need MAG board
[x] interpolate emulated data
[x][] Tasks -> add 2nd timer for dual bus interop
[x][] Fujitsu -> needs error callback to callback(context) not Signals_Next_IO
[x] Merge MFG segment changes gyro, accel & mag
[x] Merge INST segment changes
[x] CAN_DEMUX_LIVE all 3 files
[x] MCPC hang on NVRAM
[x] No syslog verify at powerup - piecemeal in loop
[x] ADAHRS fault
[x] BREAK to COAST timetout = 3 sec
[x] I2C_Force_Reset: (MCPA halted, accel error) -> port to async
[x] mag no delays/retries - runtime restarts
[x] @startup - coeffs and state, no log verification
[x] mag survey - raw mag and airspeed
[ ] Move MX Tests to Mfg only build -> M:\code\tasks\bringup\mx_tests.diff (rev 22961)
[x] Fix Autopilot revision string - in Servo200_FLT
[x] add cookit.pl to CANage - Servo200_FLT CAN_DEMUX_LIVE
[x] ccb peer review rays stuff
[x] create MX mode mag/accel survey tool - able to engage clutches
[x] Power POST to state machine - not time based
[x] new PR - at max current too long (bumper) => 2.5A
[x] override continues to drive motors -> BLDC_LOOP_MODE_BRAKE -> COAST (3 sec)
[x] PR 5696 - bart\braking override -> brake -> never coasts (br: ActMgmt_Coast)
[E] Pinremap -> pin_remap_take2 rev 24471
[ ] Low-G causes loss of ADAHRS
[ ] when engaged at boot and disengaged - actuators don't disengage -> sys state is GOOD
    detect MCP_ENGAGED_AT_BOOT in MCP_State.c::MCP_State_Process_Medians @first_sharing
[ ] Look for override in Hall POST
[ ] Fix 3axis-cal create new PR for remote accel - see 5697
[ ] Fix 3axis-cal #of cals in Mfg seg (=3)
[ ] Fix 3axis-cal accum 2 accels (remote + local)
[ ] Fix 3axis-cal calc orientation & correction
[ ] Valid vector and matrix structures
[ ] spew cal matrices on startup
[ ] Stop ADP flash if a processor dies on startup only
[ ] ADP G-limiting control code (0.7 - 1.3) range (Jeff)
[ ] recdec.py -> do AST parsing directly
[ ] CAN bus delays (no parse -u)
[ ] CBIT monitor valid sensor data (mag, accel, gyro, air) in Sensor_Mgmt
[ ] Remove remote ACCEL structure from remote Mfr segment
[*] Add override, PCI and brake_path ADC scaling coeffs to Signals_MCP.c
[D] Tools: Coefficient Changer - readback/verify/retry
[ ] HW: ADU Pin remap: I2C_Bus_0 & Addr=0x20/ LED_out:PE0, Tone:PG4, PF5=?

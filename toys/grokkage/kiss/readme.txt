sorting: http://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/bubble-sort
    [x] Bubble Sort.    : each largest element bubbles down to end
    [x] Insertion Sort. : puts item in correct location each iteration
    [x] Selection Sort. : find smallest and exchg with first position
    [ ] Quick Sort.     : 
    [ ] Merge Sort.     : 
    [ ] Heap Sort.      : 
    [x] Bit Sort        :

arrays: zip 
list: zip
search: bin, boyer
tree: avl
dp: 
bits: 
btree: dbase

Graph algorithms:
    Breadth First Search
    Depth First Search
    Shortest Path from source to all vertices - Dijkstra
    Shortest Path from every vertex to every other vertex - Floyd Warshall
    Minimum Spanning tree - Prim
    Minimum Spanning tree - Kruskal
    Topological Sort

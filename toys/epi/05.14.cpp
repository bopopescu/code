/* The open doors problem
 * Five hundred closed doors along a corridor are numbered from 1 to 500.  A person
 * walks through the corridor and opens each door.  Another person walks through the
 * corridor and closes every alternate door.  Continuing in the manner, the i-th person
 * comes and toggles the position of every i-th door starting from door i.
 *
 * Which doors are open after the 500-th person has walked through?

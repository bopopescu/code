/*
 * Check if a board game is winnable
 *
 * In a particular board game, players have to try to advance
 * through a sequence of positions. Each position has a nonnegative
 * integer associated with it, representing the maximum you can 
 * advance from that position in one move. For example, let
 * A = <3,3,1,0,2,0,1> represent the board game, ie, the i-th
 * entry in A is the maximum we can advance from i. Then the
 * following sequence of advances leads to the last position
 * <1,3,2>. If A = <3,2,0,0,2,0,1> it is not possible to advance
 * past position 3.
 *
 * Write a function which takes an array of n integers, where 
 * A[i] denotes the maximum you can advance from index i, and
 * returns whether it is possible to advance to the last index
 * starting from the beginning of the array.

Dashboard in Go:
1. Write a server for your application. A simple http listener, some handlers, authenticaton, 
    take care about sessions, maybe a middleware :thinking:, add a file server 
    (important :point_up:), eventually use gorilla/mux 5) for routing.
2. Write some nested templates (in Go) to show the frontend. Here probably you need a 
    login page and a dashboard template (bootstrap or whatever). Tip: Be careful at 
    template delimiters when you work with frontend frameworks!
3. Write some api endpoints in backend to access the data (http handlers).
4. Query the endpoints periodically and update the frontend (you can use Angular 
        $http directive to do this easy but is not mandatory, use whatever you know better).

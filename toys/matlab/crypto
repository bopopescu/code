repeating letter patterns: TH, SH, RE, CH, TR, ING, ION, and ENT.

most common two-letter words, in order of frequency, are OF, TO, IN, IS, and IT.

most common three-letter words, in order of frequency, are THE, AND, FOR, WAS, and HIS.

the most common four-letter word is THAT. An encrypted word with the pattern 1 _ _ 1

double letters are most likely to be LL, followed in frequency by EE, SS, OO, 
and TT (and on to less commonly seen doubles).

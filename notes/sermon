Jonah 4: respect
anger management
what is spiritual maturity = love others => being like Jesus

1 Cor 13:1-3
Gal 5:6 - faith through love, substance
Gen 1:27 our purpose - to reflect God
Rom 8:29 end game .. conformity to the image of his Son.
1 Jn 3:2 we are God's children NOW, .....

Back to Jonah:
Jonah was displeased (offended) = he called what God did evil
Joel 2:13, Neh, .. Ps, .. "gracious, umerciful, slow to anger, .."

Prodigal Son similarity
    the other brother is the main point
    Luke 15:25 ".. he was angry .."
    Booth & plant - he appoints things in our lives (Lk 15:8-10)
Jonah rejoiced over his own comfort - selfishness
God sends east wind .. bad day for Jonah
God has compassion!!!!!
Ask God for compassion, transformation, towards people who don't know
    right from left (confused)

Mt Sinai -- Ex 34:5-7 (re-read this)
    glowing -> us radiating image in the mist of this world

1. Bask in His glory/the Son
2. Yield to the Spirit - 2 Cor 3:18
    obey, thru actions, attitudes, heart
3. Manifest His glory - Gal 2:20 - fruit

============
1 Jn 1:1-4 - the prologue of John
For those who are discouraged, bummed or confused.  This is a letter of 
encouragement following a church split precipitated by doceticism: 1 Jn 4:2-3

watch for attacks:
1. our testimony of Jesus Christ - marturion
2. our trust in the word of God - Pr 3:5 trust in the Lord with your heart...
3. our heart, inner life - 1 Pet 3:4 the hidden person of the heart
4. our walks, outer life -> words, obedience - Col 4:5 walk in wisdom towards outsiders

Jn 1:1-5,14,18 (Gen 1)

DNA (4 parts)
=============    
1. Experience Jesus personally
    word = logos -> governing dynamics -> Higgs boson - Col 1:17 He holds all things together
    Acts 17, 1 Jn 5:11 - we have life in Jesus
2. Share the message of life - testify, verbalize
    we were spiritually stillborn - Jn 17:3 this is eternal life ... to know Him ..
    pray for the worst unbeliever & be ready
    pick 5: jay, steve, chris, jp, chad, grant
3. Fellowship w/Jesus and His people
    pray, read (listen) Rom 8
    Rom 8:15 slavery = douleia = bondage/fear vs. adoption = huiothesia - placement and condition
        of a son - to whom it does not naturally belong, sonship is bestowed
4. Rejoice in the word of life - our joy

Schedule:
[ ] R22 maintenance 1/17 - 6/17
[ ] SDD PRs survey Daniel's list for code changes
[ ] Outer Loop
    [ ] Env Prot -> Altitude hold mode
    [ ] Hdg Comp Fltr : estimates for OL 60 days w/
    [ ] Roll Control  : test harness
        [ ] Matlab
        [ ] Unittest - hand generated vectors (sinewave) match autopilot w/model
[ ] File PR against Calibrate.cpp for usage of IDs and offsets
[ ] Fix 4 failing unit tests -> see Jenkins/SonarQube
    [ ] IIRFilter, 
    [ ] Coord Transform & 
    [ ] Servo Ctrlr
[ ] R&D:
    [ ] Roll    15 days
    [ ] Matlab  20 days
    [ ] Test harness 5 days
    [ ] Hdg Comp Fltr 15 days
[ ] Research override detection - zero point at engagement
    [ ] need monoStableFlipFlop (latch) MCP Post pin off for post so no alias
[ ] Cleanup SDD -> ARCH -> Matlab
[ ] Prep Flt OL39 -> 
    [x] Get final coefficients from AH19
    [x] Send to Ray
    [ ] New tag OL39 w/new coeffs
    [ ] Test on simulator
[ ] New feature
    [ ] vertical speed term - in gust - no push over (pitch)
    [ ] essentially a G-limit on OL pitch control
        see inner loop G-limiter
[ ] For post-FLT039
    [ ] Add telemetry flags for limiters in OL pipeline
    [ ] 2 bits / flag (hi/low)
    [ ] file PR for this addition to telemetry
    

[ ] practice MfgCal
[ ] calibrate.cpp -> needs Mfg file offsets and ID
[x] mark all PRs as CCB approved and move fwd
[ ] config dumper: parameterize
[ ] config dumper: chg absolute to relative paths
[x] config dumper: add dump of remote nvram
[ ] audit of board serialization process
[ ] add CRCs to Install and Mfg and Coeff segments in Bin segment
[ ] review new AltControlProtection code by Daniel
[ ] "envelope protection" & diff Branch_To_FTC
[ ] checkin coeffs
    -> SIM: trk prop    2.3375
            trk int     0.1450
            alt prop    0.0135
            alt int     0.0005
    -> FLT: trk prop    2.5375
            trk int     0.1250
            alt prop    ??????
            alt int     ??????
[ ] debug coeff_builders && trace outer loop Gains => sample time mismatches --> +ZOHs
[ ] prep CPD for peer review and CCB: NEW/OLD, WAS/IS
[ ] debug transient following CPD mode

The year was 94' and Bezos was working diligently on Wall Street. 
At 30 years old, he began to see the internet revolution take place, 
and made the decision to quit his job and start an internet company.

The wake up call was finding this startling statistic that web usage 
in the spring of 1994 was growing at 2,300 percent a year. You know, 
things just don’t grow that fast. It’s highly unusual, and that 
started me about thinking, “What kind of business plan might make 
sense in the context of that growth?

After making a list of the ‘top 20' products that he could potentially 
sell on the internet, he decided on books because of their low cost 
and universal demand. It turns out, it was just the beginning..

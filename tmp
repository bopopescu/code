To Do List:
==========
[ ] Fix IPC errors
[ ] Root cause HAP failures in flight 20170106_Heading_Hold_2 and 20170105_Heading_Hold
[ ] Modify Pitch Inner Loop to match Roll Inner Loop
[ ] Update unit tests for new pitch inner loop
[ ] Add Build, Version, and CRC print out information in all builds (currently only in Debug)
[ ] Add printout of profiling info in RELEASE builds
[ ] Put a memset prototype in a header somewhere where all of the blocks can access it without having to #include <string.h>
[ ] Autopilot response to CPD Trigger
[ ] Maintenance Application needs to display raw sensor data for installation/debugging/etc. - Select sensor from menu
[ ] Rename "FAULT_SOFTWARE" to something descriptive
[ ] Figure out why screen went blank when CPD fired while HAP was in ALT hold mode
[ ] Retune autopilot so no overshoot in normal mode (turns, climb/descent, accelerate/decelerate)
[ ] OuterLoop Airspeed Gain Scheduling for ALT, HDG, SPD
[ ] Override Detection/Response/Handling
[ ] Change Actuator Limits depending on Speed
[ ] Building/Running with TF Avionics Library
[ ] Stack Monitoring
[ ] Automate Flight Test Data Analysis
[ ] Adding Error Handling to existing modules

[ ] Layered checkins - by PR
    [ ] Buttons
    [ ] Enum stringify & CAN svn spew
    [ ] Roll Control: IL & OL
    [ ] 1376: EnvProt 

HdgHold contains ==> create merge candidate:
    HAP_unit_test.h => supports vs2013
    Roll_Target_Gen: cunit and munit
    Fixed button control logic
    Fault_Enum literals
    Telemetry
    SVN version CAN spew

    ??? ADP\Annunciators_IBIT.c -- light up annunciator, 
    new CAN_DEMUX2
    new build types: coeff builds for all types
    inner loop: feedback.c
    CoeffChanger: now supports MCP
    MaintenanceDisplay: supports scripting

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
summary to do:
[ ] merge mxapp => can_demux POC
[ ] coefficient builder
    C:\helitrak\HdgHold\SimModel\HAP\Autopilot_ARCH_ADP_RollTargetGen_setCfgValues.m

[ ] unit tests: roll control
[ ] ambient light cal: => y:ambient2.ino
    => user input: gain and integration time
[ ] HdgHoldCRC -- OMG debug this
[ ] SP & PP different tones : HdgHoldTone
[ ] LCD STM board - start w/pure demo code, update tool chain
[ ] debug PFM release build on jenkins - works locally on HdgHold

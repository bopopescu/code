SW Development:
==============
[ ] file PRs -- catch up
[b] Fix IPC errors
    [x] Add 8 new faults
    [ ] print faults from single MCP
[b] Root cause HAP failures in flight 20170106_Heading_Hold_2 and 20170105_Heading_Hold
    FAULT_FORCE_CAUTION             - ? 
    FAULT_FORCE_TONE                - ?
    FAULT_USER_INPUT_LOOP_A_OPEN    - ?
    [x] instrument FAULT_AIRSPEED_BAD_DATA         - instrumented Sensor_Mgmt.c::Sensor_Mgmt_Run_Filtering
[ ] Modify Pitch Inner Loop to match Roll Inner Loop
[ ] Update unit tests for new pitch inner loop
[x] Add Build, Version, and CRC print out information in all builds (currently only in Debug)
[b] Re-add CRCs to Build spew above    
[b] Add printout of profiling info in RELEASE builds
[b] Put a memset prototype in a header somewhere where all of the blocks can access it without having to #include <string.h>
[ ] Autopilot response to CPD Trigger
[b] Maintenance Application needs to display raw sensor data for installation/debugging/etc. - Select sensor from menu
[x] Rename "FAULT_SOFTWARE" to something descriptive
[ ] Figure out why screen went blank when CPD fired while HAP was in ALT hold mode
[ ] Retune autopilot so no overshoot in normal mode (turns, climb/descent, accelerate/decelerate)
[ ] OuterLoop Airspeed Gain Scheduling for ALT, HDG, SPD
[ ] Override Detection/Response/Handling
[ ] Change Actuator Limits depending on Speed
[ ] Building/Running with TF Avionics Library
[ ] Stack Monitoring
[ ] Automate Flight Test Data Analysis
[ ] Adding Error Handling to existing modules

SW Tools:
========
[ ] [edit]Maintenance Application
[ ] Download Log
[ ] Decode Error Codes (diagnose issues)
[ ] Clear Log
[ ] Installation Calibration
[ ] Add Manufacturing Calibration data to Matlab Test Script
[ ] Display Autopilot Statistics
[ ] Capture Debug Info (including startup messages, software version, etc.)
[ ] Installation Configuration/Test/Debug
[ ] [edit]Manufacturing Calibration Application
[ ] Remote Magnetometer Manufacturing Calibration Application
[ ] [edit]Manufacturing/Diagnostic POST Application
[ ] [edit]Coefficient Changer
[ ] Add an option in the CoeffChanger for entering a value in degrees and having it convert to radians and set the value.
[ ] Add a display of the current value instead of having to look at the terminal printout to see the values.
[ ] [edit]Flight Test Video Data Extraction
[ ] [edit]X-Plane Scenario Setup/Loader (for System Validation)

Extras:
======
[ ] Coeff builder calculator
[ ] Coeff builder getter
[ ] Coefficient matlab builder
[ ] tracer.c

[ ] Layered checkins - by PR
    [ ] Buttons
    [ ] Enum stringify & CAN svn spew
    [ ] Roll Control: IL & OL
    [ ] 1376: EnvProt 

HdgHold contains ==> create merge candidate:
    HAP_unit_test.h => supports vs2013
    Roll_Target_Gen: cunit and munit
    Fixed button control logic
    Fault_Enum literals
    Telemetry
    SVN version CAN spew

    ??? ADP\Annunciators_IBIT.c -- light up annunciator, 
    new CAN_DEMUX2
    new build types: coeff builds for all types
    inner loop: feedback.c
    CoeffChanger: now supports MCP
    MaintenanceDisplay: supports scripting

Num     Type    Mode        Key     Equivalent Major Key
===     ====    ====        ===     ====================
 1      Maj     Ionian      C       C   1  Maj scale
 2      min     Dorian      Am      G   b7 Maj scale (down 2 frets)

 7      dim     Locrian     B       C   b2 Maj scale (up 1 fret)

Note:
The number of the mode is the degree on the major scale that is the 
starting point of the mode scale:

Ionion      = 1, so on G major scale, it starts on G
Dorian      = 2, so on G major scale, it starts on A
Phrygian    = 3, so on G major scale, it starts on B
Lydian      = 4, so on G major scale, it starts on C
Mixolydian  = 5, so on G major scale, it starts on D
Aeolian     = 6, so on G major scale, it starts on E
Locrian     = 7, so on G major scale, it starts on F

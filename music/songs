Melissa

[Intro]
E F#m G#m F#m

[Verse]

E         F#m                G#m    F#m
Crossroads, seem to come and go, yeah.
E                             F#m                   
The gypsy flies from coast to coast
A       Bm            C#m   D
Knowing many, loving none,
E       F#m             G#m   A         
Bearing sorrow havin' fun,
C                           B                 E F#m G#m F#m
But back home he'll always run to sweet melissa... mmm...

E             F#m                   G#m   F#m                   
Freight train, each car looks the same, all the same.
E                       F#m           
And no one knows the gypsy's name


[Chorus]

A       Bm               C#m    D      
No one hears his lonely sigh,
E              F#m                G#m A      
There are no blankets where he lies.
C                                     B                 E F#m G#m F#m
In all his deepest dreams the gypsy flies with sweet melissa... mmm...


[Verse]

E
Again the morning's come,
D
Again he's on the run,
A
Sunbeams shining through his hair,
B
Appearing not to have a care.
C#m                                 A       B
Well, pick up your gear and gypsy roll on, roll on.

E          F#m                     G#m        F#m
Crossroads, will you ever let him go? (lord, lord)
E                        F#m
Will you hide the dead man's ghost,
A          Bm                C#m     D
Or will he lie, beneath the clay,
E              F#m          G#m       A
Or will his spirit roll away? 


[Chorus]

C                          B               E F#m G#m F#m
But I know that he won't stay without melissa.
C                          B               E F#m G#m F#m
Yes I know that he won't stay without melissa.
